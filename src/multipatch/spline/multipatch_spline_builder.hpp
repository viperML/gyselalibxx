/**
 * @brief A class to call all the builders of all the patches once.
 *
 * We need to instantiate all the builders for all the pacthes in the main code.
 * We process the same way for the Field containing the spline coefficients and the
 * values of the function on each patch. The Fields are stored in MultipatchType
 * objects. The builders are stored in this class.
 * This class is instantiated with all the builders.
 * The operator() allows to call all the builders stored in the member of this class in 
 * one single line.
 *
 * This function is useful to avoid calling all the builders individually, especially in
 * a multipatch geometry with several patches.
 *
 * @tparam ExecSpace The space (CPU/GPU) where the calculations are carried out.
 * @tparam MemorySpace The space (CPU/GPU) where the coefficients and values are stored.
 * @tparam BSplineOnPatch A type alias which provides the BSpline type along which the splines are built.
 * @tparam GridOnPatch A type alias which provides the Grid type along which the interpolation points of the splines are found.
 * @tparam BcLower The lower boundary condition.
 * @tparam BcUpper The upper boundary condition.
 * @tparam Solver The SplineSolver giving the backend used to perform the spline approximation. See DDC for more details.
 * @tparam ValuesOnPatch A type alias which provides the field type which will be used to pass the values of the function
 *                      at the interpolation points. The index range of this field type should contain any batch dimensions.
